The main challenge was forecasting the LTV of a company's customers in the next 90 days. For this, the event organizers provided a sales record comprehending Jan/2020-Feb/2021 period from an actual retailer company. The submissions scores were based on the RMSE metric. The present solution performed feature engineering to obtain a cross-sectional approach to the problem. In this way, the 90-days LTV of a given customer is predicted based on its 11 previous month sales history.
